## Course Description

This course focuses on theoretical and practical challenges for conducting research involving individuals from more than one cultural background or ethnicity. Topics include defining and measuring culture; developing culture-sensitive studies; choice of language and translation; communication styles and bias; questionnaire and interview design; qualitative and quantitative data analysis for cultural and cross-cultural research; minorities, power, and ethics in cross-cultural research; and ethno-methodologies and indigenous research methodologies. Appropriate background for this course: PSYC 338.

## Course Learning Objectives

In this advanced course, students develop foundational skills in cross-cultural psychological research with a strong emphasis on causal inference.

1. **Programming in R.** Students will learn the basics of programming in the statistical language R, gaining essential computational tools for psychological research. These skills lay the foundation for applying data analysis techniques in a causal inference framework and beyond.

2. **Understanding causal inference.** Students will develop a robust understanding of causal inference concepts and approaches, with particular emphasis on how they mitigate common pitfalls in cross-cultural research. We focus on designing studies, analysing data, and drawing strong conclusions about cause-and-effect relationships across cultures.

3. **Understanding measurement in comparative settings.** Students will learn techniques for constructing and validating psychometrically sound measures across diverse cultures. We examine how to ensure measurements are reliable, cross-culturally valid, and aligned with theoretical constructs while focusing strongly on causal reasoning.
