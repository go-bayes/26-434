# Extensions and Materials

## Extensions

Negotiate a new due date by writing (email) before the mid-term test. Every reasonable request will be accepted (e.g. too many assignments falling in the same week, you want another week to complete).

## Penalties

Late submissions incur a one full grade-per-week penalty: e.g. if late by one day, B becomes C; one week later, C becomes D. Over-length assignments will be penalised.

## Unforeseeable Events

Extensions will require evidence (e.g. medical certificate).

## Materials and Equipment

Bring a laptop with R and RStudio installed for data analysis sessions. Contact the instructor if you lack computer access. For in-class tests, bring a writing utensil. Electronic devices are **not permitted** during tests.
