## Seminar

### Learning outcomes

- You will learn the elementary structures of measurement error bias and be able to use them to explain how measurement can go wrong.
- You will begin to understand the relationship between structural sources of bias and measurement in cross-cultural studies.
- You will begin to understand how the concepts of target population and sample population clarify external validity and transportability of results in cross-cultural research.
